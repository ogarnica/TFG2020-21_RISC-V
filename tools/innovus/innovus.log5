Extraction called for design 'swerv_wrapper' of instances=38868023 and nets=130698 using extraction engine 'postRoute' at effort level 'high' .
Integrated QRC (IQuantus) Extraction in Multi-Corner mode called for design 'swerv_wrapper'. Number of corners is 1.
No IQuantus parasitic data in Innovus. Going for full-chip extraction.
Shrink Factor (or layout scale) value 0.9 specified in Quantus qrc technology file as well as tool's setup will be applied on geometries for extraction.
IQuantus Extraction invoked in single CPU mode. Commands setDistributeHost/setMultiCpuUsage can be used to activate multiCPU extraction.
