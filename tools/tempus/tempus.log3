Setting -optimize_cross_via to 1. ViaGen will try to generate vias with the minimum enclosure.
addStripe will allow jog to connect padcore ring and block ring.

Stripes will not extend to closest target.
When breaking rings, the power planner will consider the existence of blocks.
addStripe will break automatically at non-default domains when generating global stripes over the core area or default domain.
The entire stripe set will break at the domain if one of the nets is not in the domain.
Stripes will not be created over regions without power planning wires.
Offset for stripe breaking is set to 0.
Stripes will stop at the boundary of the specified area.
The power planner will set stripe antenna targets to none (no trimming allowed).

          To modify the active set of constraints you can use one of the following means:
          - Use the set_analysis_view command to change the set of active views.
          - Use the update_analysis_view command to change the constraint mode associated with an active view.
          - Use the update_constraint_mode command to change the set of SDC files pointed to be active modes.
